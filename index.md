<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About Me</h2>

I am currently a postgraduate student at the School of Computer Science and Engineering at [Macau University of Science and Technology](https://www.must.edu.mo/en), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Professor Zhanchuan Cai](https://www.must.edu.mo/en/scse/staff/cai-zhan-chuan). Before this, I received my Bachelor degree in Engineering from [Shandong University](https://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/) in 2019. Subsequently, I obtained another Bachelor degree in Science from [China Agricultural University](https://www.cau.edu.cn/) in 2022.

My research interests include image enhancement, image generation, and speech synthesis.

I am expected to graduate in August 2024 and am currently seeking a Ph.D. position. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested.
