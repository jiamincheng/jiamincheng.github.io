<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About Me</h2>

I am currently a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at [Binghamton University](https://www.binghamton.edu/), and I am fortunate to be supervised by Professor [Monika Roznere](http://monikaroznere.com/index.html).

My research interests focus on underwater robotic perception.
