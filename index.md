<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About Me</h2>

I am a graduate student pursuing a degree in Applied Mathematics and Data Science at [Macau University of Science and Technology](https://www.must.edu.mo/en), where I am fortunate to be mentored by [Professor Cai Zhanchuan](https://www.must.edu.mo/en/scse/staff/cai-zhan-chuan). Before this, I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree from [Shandong University](https://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/) in 2015 and my Bachelor of Science degree from [China Agricultural University](https://www.cau.edu.cn/) in 2020.

I am expected to graduate in June 2024 and am currently seeking a PhD position. My research interests include image enhancement, image generation, speech synthesis, and more.
