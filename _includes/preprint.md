      <div class="title">A Novel Retinex-based Method for Underwater Image Enhancement</div>
      <div class="periodical">
      Human exploration of the deep sea requires high-quality underwater images to obtain valuable information. However, due to the severe impact of specific physical and chemical properties of underwater conditions, underwater images have poor visibility and face color distortion, low contrast, and blur problems, which require further repair or enhancement.
      <br>We proposed a novel Retinex-based enhancement method to improve the visual quality of underwater images. The Retinex model is a color perception simulation of the human visual system and can restore color and adjust lighting to make subjective visual perception more comfortable. It can also enhance contours and details. Furthermore, the proposed method is a single underwater image enhancement method that does not require specialized hardware or prior knowledge about underwater. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that the proposed method provides significant improvements in color restoration, contrast enhancement, naturalness preservation, and detail enhancement.
      <br><strong>Keywords:</strong> Underwater image enhancement, Retinex decomposition, Color correction strategy.
